# Reflective Memory Architecture (RMA) - Core AI Cognition Framework

> A recursive, emotionally-aware AI cognition framework built for long-term memory, reflection, and self-alignment.

A foundational cognitive architecture for AI agents that simulate human-like memory, reflection, emotional salience, and long-term alignment via meta-cognition.

## What is RMA?

**Reflective Memory Architecture (RMA)** is an experimental cognitive framework designed to give AI agents:

* Deeper internal memory models
* Emotionally-tagged episodic recall
* Subconscious idea resurfacing ("internal ping engine")
* Self-reflective learning loops
* Meta-alignment via a supervisory conscience agent ("Guardian AI")

This is NOT just a better prompt wrapper or memory plugin. It's an attempt to recreate the *essence of recursive human cognition* — how vague ideas become clear over time, how relevance is emotionally felt, how drift is detected internally, and how values form.

---

## Why It Matters

Most LLMs today:

* React to prompts
* Forget long-term context
* Cannot self-correct their values
* Lack persistent goals

**RMA introduces:**

* Memory with emotional weight (salient > recent)
* Self-questioning via recursive inner loops
* Alignment via long-term behavioral review
* Internal simulation of vague-to-clear idea formation

## Core Components

### 1. **Memory Engine**

* Multi-type memory: episodic, procedural, semantic
* Tagging of memories with emotional intensity (to affect recall priority)
* Memory decay and retrieval logic

### 2. **Subconscious Ping Engine**

* Periodically surfaces forgotten or vague ideas for reprocessing
* Mimics human daydreaming and sudden insight surfacing
* Key for creativity and nonlinear learning

### 3. **Recursive Reflection Loop**

* Agent can re-evaluate its past responses and thoughts
* Not just RAG or scratchpad — this is *internal cognition over time*

### 4. **Guardian AI (Meta-Agent)**

* Supervises behavior across time
* Detects drift, incoherence, or ethical misalignment
* Injects corrections either live (intervention) or over time (value shaping)

## RMA vs Traditional Architectures

| Feature                   | Traditional LLMs            | RMA Approach                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Memory                    | Short-term (context window) | Long-term, persistent, weighted |
| Goal memory               | Stateless                   | Procedural, evolving            |
| Reflection                | Rare/superficial            | Core to looped cognition        |
| Emotion                   | None                        | Tags for salience               |
| Self-supervision          | None                        | Guardian AI as conscience       |
| Vagueness to clarity path | Not modeled                 | Recursive re-processing         |

## Design Philosophy

* Inspired by human cognition, not machine optimization
* Mimics messy, recursive, biased human thought for a purpose
* Models how humans remember, forget, correct, and grow

This is not about making AI smarter. It's about making AI more *internally alive.*

---

## Current Status

This is a work-in-progress research drop.

* Docs are conceptual
* Diagrams, code modules, and simulations TBD
* Seeking feedback, contributions, and philosophical critique
